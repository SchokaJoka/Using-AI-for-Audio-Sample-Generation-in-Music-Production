    "# Oneshot Maker: Generate Drum and Instrument Oneshots with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Oneshot Maker is a tool designed for music producers to generate short audio samples, known as \"oneshots,\" for drums and instruments using AI. It leverages the `stackadoc/stable-audio-open-1.0` model on Replicate, which is optimized for creating sound effects and production elements from text prompts.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## ‚ú® Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AI-Powered Oneshots:** Generate drum and instrument oneshots from text descriptions.\n",
    "* **Optimized for Short Audio:** Ideal for creating punchy percussion sounds or melodic instrument samples.\n",
    "* **Contextual Prompt Generation:** Integrates with `openai/gpt-4o` to create detailed and appropriate prompts for the audio generation model, distinguishing between short drum sounds and pitched instrument samples (like 808s or bass sounds).\n",
    "* **Customizable Parameters:** Control aspects of the audio generation, including steps, guidance scale, and total duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The Oneshot Maker workflow involves crafting a precise text prompt and feeding it to the Stable Audio Open model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Prompt Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "A key aspect of this tool is the intelligent prompt generation. An `openai/gpt-4o` model acts as a \"music producer assistant\". Its role is to take a concise `user_prompt` (e.g., \"short electronic kick\") and expand it into a more descriptive prompt suitable for generating specific types of oneshots.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Drum Shots:** For drum sounds, the system prompt emphasizes that they should be very short and produce a single percussion sound.\n",
    "* **Instrument Shots:** For instrument sounds (like 808s or sub-bass), the prompt is designed to be a bit longer and, crucially, to specify a single key so that the generated sample can be easily pitched.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Audio Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The refined prompt is then passed to the `stackadoc/stable-audio-open-1.0` model on Replicate. This model uses the prompt and various parameters (such as `seed`, `steps`, `cfg_scale`, `sigma_max`, `sigma_min`, `batch_size`, `sampler_type`, `seconds_start`, `seconds_total`, and `negative_prompt`) to generate the audio oneshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Output Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated audio is returned as a direct URL to the `.wav` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python 3.8+\n",
    "* A Replicate API Token\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Set your Replicate API Token:**\n",
    "    Replace `\"YOUR_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN\"` with your actual token."
