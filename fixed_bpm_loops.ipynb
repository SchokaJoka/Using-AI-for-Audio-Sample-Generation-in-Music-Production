    "# MusicGen-Looper: Generate Fixed-BPM Loops from Text Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "MusicGen-Looper is a Python-based tool that leverages AI to generate high-quality, fixed-BPM (beats per minute) musical loops from simple text prompts. Built upon the powerful [MusicGen](https://replicate.com/andreasjansson/musicgen-looper/readme) model for audio generation and [BeatNet](https://replicate.com/andreasjansson/musicgen-looper/readme) for precise beat detection, this project simplifies the creation of custom instrumental loops for various musical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Features\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Text-to-Loop Generation:** Describe your desired loop in plain text, and MusicGen-Looper will generate corresponding audio.\n",
    "  * **Fixed BPM Output:** All generated loops are time-stretched to precisely match your specified BPM, ensuring seamless integration into your projects.\n",
    "  * **Multiple Variations:** Get a range of creative options with multiple loop variations generated from a single prompt.\n",
    "  * **AI-Powered Prompt Enhancement (Optional):** Integrate with GPT-4o to transform concise user prompts into detailed descriptions for richer musical outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "MusicGen-Looper employs a sophisticated workflow to create your loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initial Music Generation:** Your text prompt, augmented with the requested BPM, is fed into MusicGen to produce an initial audio segment.\n",
    "2.  **Beat and Downbeat Detection:** BeatNet analyzes this audio to identify beats and downbeats, from which an even number of bars are extracted for looping.\n",
    "3.  **Variation Creation:** MusicGen's continuation feature is utilized. The last bar of the first generated variation serves as input to the continuation model, enabling the creation of diverse additional variations.\n",
    "4.  **Precise Tempo Matching:** All generated variations are time-stretched using the Rubberband library to ensure they perfectly align with the requested BPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Tempo Accuracy:** An error will be thrown if the actual tempo of the first variation deviates by more than +/-10 BPM from the requested tempo.\n",
    "  * **BeatNet Limitations:** BeatNet may occasionally struggle with accurate downbeat detection, which could lead to loops starting on a beat other than the first.\n",
    "  * **MusicGen Limitations:** The generated audio is subject to MusicGen's capabilities, meaning it currently cannot generate vocals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Python 3.8+\n",
    "  * A Replicate API Token\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Set your Replicate API Token:**\n",
    "    Replace `\"YOUR_REPLICATE_API_TOKEN\"` with your actual token.\n",
    "\n"
